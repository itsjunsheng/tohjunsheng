# Personal Portfolio Website

Hello! I'm **Jun Sheng**

This repository contains the source code for my **portfolio webpage**, where I showcase my education, CCAs, work experiences and personal projects. I enjoy exploring new technologies and turning innovative ideas into real-world applications. Feel free to reach out for collaboration or opportunities and I'd be happy to connect! 😊
